# The Computer Chess Index (CCI)

A curated, structured and evolving catalog of computer chess engines, benchmarks, and configurations.

---

## 🧩 About

The **Computer Chess Index (CCI)** aims to create a comprehensive, transparent, and historically aware registry of chess engines and their technical characteristics.

The project provides:
- A relational dataset of chess engines, versions, authors, and benchmarks.
- Metadata about architectures, evaluation techniques, and supported platforms.
- Automated routines for dataset import, transformation, and validation.
- Periodic reports and analyses of engine evolution.

The purpose is **documentation, reproducibility, and preservation** – not competition or ranking.

## 🧱 Project Goals

1. **Cataloging**  
   Gather and maintain structured metadata for as many chess engines as possible (past and present).

2. **Standardization**  
   Define a stable schema for technical and historical attributes.

3. **Transparency**  
   Make information reproducible and verifiable.

4. **Accessibility**  
   Provide open formats (CSV, SQL, JSON) for research and archival purposes.

## ⚙️ Technical Structure

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/data/` | Raw and normalized datasets (e.g. engine list, benchmarks) |
| `/schema/` | Database structure definitions |
| `/scripts/` | Import and transformation routines |
| `/reports/` | Aggregated summaries and analyses |
| `/docs/` | Reference documentation and changelogs |

## 🕰️ Status

Currently in early data curation phase.  
The focus is on establishing reliable identifiers, metadata validation routines, and version control of the dataset.

## 🧠 Inspiration

> “A machine that plays chess is not just a tool — it is a mirror of our reasoning.”

The **Computer Chess Index** preserves this evolving dialogue between human thought and algorithmic design.
