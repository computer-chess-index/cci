# The Computer Chess Index (CCI)

A growing reference list and documentation project for computer chess engines.

---

## 🧩 About

The **Computer Chess Index (CCI)** is an open and continuously evolving attempt  
to document, organize, and preserve information about computer chess engines —  
their origins, versions, and development over time.

The goal is to provide a *reliable reference structure* for anyone interested in  
the technical and historical landscape of computer chess.

This repository begins as a **personal initiative**,  
built around data collection, normalization routines, and transparent reporting.

---

## 🧱 Current Focus

- Collecting and verifying public information on known chess engines  
- Building a clean, consistent data model for long-term use  
- Publishing regular update reports and basic metadata exports  
- Exploring automated data imports and validation workflows

## ⚙️ Structure (planned)

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `/data/` | Collected datasets (CSV, JSON) |
| `/schema/` | Database structure and relations |
| `/scripts/` | Import and transformation routines |
| `/reports/` | Summaries and update logs |
| `/docs/` | General documentation and background notes |

## 🕰️ Status

Early stage – initial data gathering and format definition.  
Expect frequent revisions and structural changes.

If you’d like to contribute by sharing verified information,  
suggesting structure improvements, or testing data workflows,  
contributions and feedback are welcome.
