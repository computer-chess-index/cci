# The Computer Chess Index (CCI)

A growing reference list and documentation project for computer chess engines.

---

## 🧩 About

The **Computer Chess Index (CCI)** is an open and continuously evolving attempt  
to document, organize, and preserve information about computer chess engines —  
their origins, versions, and development over time.

The goal is to provide a *reliable reference structure* for anyone interested in  
the technical and historical landscape of computer chess.

This repository begins as a **personal initiative**,  
built around data collection, normalization routines, and transparent reporting.

## 🧱 Current Focus

- Collecting and verifying public information on known chess engines  
- Building a clean, consistent data model for long-term use  
- Publishing regular update reports and basic metadata exports  
- Exploring automated data imports and validation workflows
